Instructions/Order Of Operations
=================================

SIDENOTE: Because of how the floor textures are named when saved, for convenience, 
If you are editing them in a program like Aseprite for example, or another art software that automatically detects
importing animation frames, open up the FIRST floor plan texture first when editing and it will automatically detect this and ask you
to import them in a series of numbered frames, this can allow you to more cohesively switch between previous floor frames
to see how you should be constructing that floor

1.) Make sure the level editor script is on an empty GameObject in the scene, 
set up editor bool toggles to your liking and map materials, and drag in map parent (that empty object) and your player transform

2.) Click the Create Editor Directory button if not already created

3.) Add your map objects, set up their pixel colors, and set up player spawn point 
(spawn point is optional but recommended if you use spawn points in your game as it does neat editor camera stuff)

4.) Navigate to the new directory and into the floor plans folder, these are where all your floor textures are stored with a black dot
marking the center of the map, do changes to the first floorplan texture first with MSPaint or any other art software
if you have "show previous floors" enabled and want multiple floors to copy over the first floors texture to "extrude that same floor upwards".
Just change the floor plan list size and it will extrude the previous floor upward.
(You can skip this step and disable "show previous floors" if you want new floors you make to be completely empty)

5.) Make sure you change the floorplan list size for how many floors you want your map to be

6.) Make sure you modify the floor plan textures with MSPaint or any other software to your liking

7.) Make sure to refresh the floor plans after each external edit

8.) Create the map! Changes should be reflected in the world!


Settings and what they do:
==========================

Require Player Spawn Point: Throws an error in the console complaining about issues with spawn points in the map if any,
for instance, if you have multiple on one map or don't have one at all and want to enforce it

Save Map Edits To Scene: Saves the scene and all map objects you may have created when you do Clear Map or Create Map

Show Previous Floor: Copies previous floor texture when adding to the floor plan list so you don't have to redraw that previous floor


Buttons/Actions and what they do:
=================================

Recreate Floor Plans: Recreates all floor plan textures back to default, aka just a black pixel in the middle of them

Refresh floor plans: Refreshes all floor plan textures in the floor plan list so the level editor reads your changes

Create Map: Constructs the map in the world reading the pixel data from the floor plans

Clear Map: Clears out all floors and map objects in the world, wiping the scene clean

Create Editor Directory: Creates the level editor directory and first floor plan texture

Delete Editor Directory: Deletes the level editor directory and all files
